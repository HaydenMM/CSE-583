You are given starter code for CSE 583/EE 552 PRML Project 1  which contains the following: 

- Part 1, in the linear_regression.py file you will have the functions:
  - `generateNoisyData`: a function to generate noisy sample points and save data.
  - `linearRegression`: the main function you will need to complete. It contains a sample script to load data, plot points and curves.
  - `plot_GT_data`: A visualization function to draw curve with shaded error bar.
  - In the `models.py` file, you will implement your ML and MAP classes from scrath. If you choose to implement a classifier, you will also do such in this file.

## Packages
This project will use three primary packages: numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib. You will likely need to install such packages via pip if you don't already have them installed.

We recommend creating a virtual environment using Anaconda for this project.

## Package Imports
You may not add any additional packages to the code. You must also write the pertinant parts of the code (such as the projection, ML, and MAP) from scratch and may only make use of numpy.

Read the project description on CANVAS for more details on the project.
